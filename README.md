This where I will put my **Stack Exchange scripts**, going forward.  
Currently, they are spread all over (or not released to the public).
But you can get many of them with [this search at Stack Apps](http://stackapps.com/search?q=user%3A7653+Greasemonkey).

**For more information on the scripts here**, use the following links:

 - [Add kbd, sup, and sub shortcuts](http://stackapps.com/q/3341/7653)
 - [Flagging tweaks](http://stackapps.com/q/7057/7653)
